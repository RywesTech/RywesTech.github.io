Title: Final Project Daily Log
---

Below is a log of my daily progress, including:

1.) What I worked on today
2.) What I learned
3.) Any road blocks or questions that I need to get answered
4.) What my goals are for tomorrow

**January 7th**
Today I read these three articles, explored the Python NLTK framework, and initiated my Git repo:
https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-bots-that-sound-like-humans-with-natural-language-processing-d9581905de
https://towardsdatascience.com/build-your-first-chatbot-using-python-nltk-5d07b027e727
https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/building-a-simple-chatbot-in-python-using-nltk-7c8c8215ac6e

The first article described the use of Seq2Seq Models, which uses two recurrent neural networks to encode the data, focus on each particular part, then decode the data. In sum, this type of model takes in a sentence, processes it one word at a time, and outputs a sentence one word at a time. Each part is accomplished by the encoder, the attention mechanism, and the decoder.
The second article takes a very simplistic approach to chatbots, but it seems like a good starting point.
The third article talks about the two ways chatbots are build today: rule-based (normally used for answering specific questions), and self-learning (generates their own replies based on a model). It also provides links to (NLTK)[https://www.nltk.org/], which seems like a helpful framework.

Some of the terminology was difficult, but I think I answered all my questions through Google. Tomorrow my goal is to take what I've learned today and start implementing it into code! I want to have a very basic chatbot this week, and improve upon it starting next week.
